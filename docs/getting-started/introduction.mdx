## What is Magnitude?

Magnitude is an open source, AI-native testing framework for web apps.

Magnitude differs from traditional test automation frameworks (like Playwright or Cypress) in that it:
- Operates on natural language test cases as opposed to relying on DOM elements
- Uses a vision-based browser agent under the hood to execute and validate the test cases
- Runs test cases dynamically, adjusting to your interface as necessary

You can think of Magnitude as "AI-native Playwright" and it should be used in the same scenarios that Playwright would be.
Because of Magnitude's full vision-based approach, test cases remain resilient to changes in your interface without needing be updated.
